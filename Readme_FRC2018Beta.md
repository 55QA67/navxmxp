Current status of the navX-MXP/Micro libraries for FRC with respect to the FRC 2018 Beta

C++ and Java are known working for all interfaces, with one exception:

Java USB is not currently working, due to a known issue opening a USB serial Port with the WPI Library for Java.  WPI has indicated that a fix for this issue will be available with FRC Beta Release 3.  Once that release is available, Kauai Labs will verify correct behavior and will update this page at that time.
